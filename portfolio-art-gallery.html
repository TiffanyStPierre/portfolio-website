        <p class="portfolio-item-individual-p">This art gallery website was created for a family member to have an online space to display her paintings. I created this website very early in my journey to becoming a developer. Because it was early in my journey, I decided to use WordPress, Elementor and an e-commerce template from Ocean WP. The use of WordPress as a CMS ensures that the website owner is able to update the art inventory on their own without having to rely on a developer to maintain the content, which is what they wanted. This was an important factor when determining the technologies used for building the website.</p>
        <p class="portfolio-item-individual-p">Although this website was created using an Ocean WP template, the process of deploying it with a hosting provider and customizing it to what I needed really taught me a lot. This was my first experience working directly with a hosting provider to deploy a live website and my first experience using WordPress. Modifying an e-commerce store theme to repurpose it as an art gallery with the cart and purchasing features turned off was a great challenge for me at this stage in my learning. In addition, learning how the e-commerce products are maintained through WooCommerce and the product dashboard was really interesting for me.</p>
        <p class="portfolio-item-individual-p">After the website was completed I provided easy to follow, detailed instructions on how to update the WooCommerce products so the artist is able to manage the website inventory without assistance. I am, of course, always available to assist with any questions and to take care of the more complicated tasks.</p>
        <p class="portfolio-item-individual-p">I am currently providing ongoing maintenance and updates for this website and technical support on an as needed basis.</p>
