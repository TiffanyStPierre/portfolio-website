        <p class="portfolio-item-individual-p">Four Feet Companion Foundation was looking for a volunteer web developer to maintain and update their website as needed. After looking at their existing website, I offered to design and build them a new website, along with providing ongoing updates, maintenance and support. They very eagerly took me up on my offer. Using Figma for the design, I was able to create a prototype based on their requirements and preferences, and work with them to fine tune it to their liking. I made sure to provide them a new design file with each revision and made sure they were 100% happy before beginning to build the website.</p>
        <p class="portfolio-item-individual-p">I built the website from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript, making sure to closely follow the approved design. This was the first built from scratch website that I launched and I learned a lot while creating it. I used a lot of flexbox and learned how to create modals and a collapsible FAQ section for the first time.</p>
        <p class="portfolio-item-individual-p">When the website was about 95% complete, I launched it to a temporary Netlify url so Four Feet Companion Foundation would have an opportunity to try it out in a live environment and provide additional feedback to be incorporated into the final product. I took that opportunity to run the Google Lighthouse analytics in the browser and fix potential performance and accessibility issues. After everything was completed and the website was ready to go live, I replaced the previous website files in their GoDaddy hosting account with the new ones and we were in business! The website was completed ahead of schedule and the end product fit perfectly with the organization's goals and mission.</p>
        <p class="portfolio-item-individual-p">I continue to volunteer and provide ongoing maintenance and updates for this website and technical support on an as needed basis.</p>
