            <p>This movie finder app uses an external API call to The Movie DB to fetch lists of the top 20 trending movies and TV shows of the week. The user can click on either the movie or TV button to get a random recommendation from the selected top 20 list. This app uses Netlify serverless functions to conceal the API key.</p>
